{"text": "Tax Policy Act 2024\nSection 1:\nThe corporate income tax rate is hereby adjusted to 22% of the total profit. This change reflects the government's commitment to maintaining a balanced budget while ensuring that corporations contribute their fair share to public finances. The additional revenue generated by this increase will be allocated to healthcare and education sectors.\nSection 2:\nThe value-added tax (VAT) is revised to 17% on all goods and services. This adjustment is aimed at addressing the growing fiscal deficit and ensuring the sustainability of public finances. The exemptions for essential goods remain unchanged, ensuring that basic needs are not disproportionately affected by this increase.\nSection 3:\nThe excise tax on alcoholic beverages is increased to 27% of the retail price. This measure is part of a broader public health strategy to reduce alcohol consumption and its associated social harms. The additional revenue will support addiction treatment programs and public health campaigns.\nSection 4:\nThe commission for domestic bank transfers is increased to 2.5% of the transfer amount. This change is intended to reflect the rising costs of maintaining secure and efficient payment systems. Financial institutions are required to disclose this fee to customers at the time of transaction.\nSection 5:\nThe property tax is adjusted to 1.5% of the assessed value of real estate. This increase is part of a broader effort to align property taxes with market values and to provide additional funding for local government services.
